Last year, I constructed a blog site using [Hexo](http://www.hexo.io) and deployed it on GitHub Pages. However, this approach currently has limitations, such as restricted data storage, limited scalability for function extensions. It is also not challenging enough to use the off-the-shelf tools and templates.

Therefore, I resolved to create a new blog site on my own.

# Feature

I would like to add the following features to my site.

## Data Storage

Articles and configuration information will be stored in a database to achieve separation between the front-end and back-end.

## Optional Management System

I would like to develop a backend management system that will enable me to publish articles, modify configurations, and synchronize with a database.

## Media Database

I aim to create a media database that can be used to showcase the films I have recently viewed, providing an avenue for me to share my opinions.

# Technology Stack

## Frame

- Next.js
-

## Front-end

- Typescript
- React

## Dependencies

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/index-cn) - An UI Component Library

## Back-end

- node.js

# Theme and Design Concept

I want my site to have a minimalist design, so I refer to the [white Hexo theme](https://github.com/FuShaoLei/hexo-theme-white). Additionally, my previous website also used this theme.

Let us develop a new blog site completely from scratch!
